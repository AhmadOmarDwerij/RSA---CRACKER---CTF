#  RSA-CTF-Decrypter

A Python tool to **decrypt RSA-encrypted messages** commonly found in CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges. Supports both **manual input** of primes `p` and `q`, or **automatic factoring** of small `n` values using `sympy`.

> For large `n`, you are encouraged to use [FactorDB](https://factordb.com) or [Integer factorization calculator][(https://www.alpertron.com) for factorization.

## Features

-  Decrypt RSA ciphertexts with known `e`, `n`, and either:
  - Manually provided primes `p` and `q`
  - Auto-factored small `n` values using `sympy.ntheory.factorint()`
-  Calculates `œÜ(n)` and the private exponent `d`
-  Converts the decrypted integer back to human-readable string (if decodable)

## Usage

- python3 decrypt_rsa.py

- You will be prompted to input:

- Ciphertext (as an integer)

- Modulus n

- Public exponent e
  
-  Either:
    - Your own values of p and q, or
    - Let the script auto-factor n (for small values)

## Example

‚îå[ahmed][17:22][~]
‚îî$ python3 decrypt_rsa.py
Enter the ciphertext:
2790
Enter the value of n (modulus):
3233
Enter the value of e (public exponent):
17

Choose an option:
1 - Enter p and q manually
0 - Automatically factor n (only for small n)
Enter your choice (0 or 1): 0
Factoring n . This may take a moment...
Found factors:
p = 61
q = 53

Calculated œÜ(n): 3120
Calculated private exponent d: 2753
Decrypted Message: hi

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
sympy.ntheory.factorint() only works on small n. If n is large (as in real RSA), factoring is impractical.
For real RSA CTFs, use FactorDB to obtain p and q.
